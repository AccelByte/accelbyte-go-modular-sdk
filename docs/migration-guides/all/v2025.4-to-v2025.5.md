# [v2025.5]

## BREAKING CHANGE

- Enum constants have been renamed to include the associated parameter name for better clarity and maintainability.
  The previous constants are now marked for deprecation and will be removed in a future release.
  Action Required: Please update your code to use the new constants going forward.

   ```diff
   - const AdminListAchievementsListOrderConstant = "listOrder"
   + const AdminListAchievementsSortByListOrderConstant = "listOrder"
     //                         ^^^^^^
   ```
